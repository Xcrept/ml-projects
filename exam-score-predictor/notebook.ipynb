# ML Tools
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # splits data into training and testing sets
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression # teaches the model how features map to target
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error # evaluates model accuracy

# Create a small fake dataset
# Each row represents one student
